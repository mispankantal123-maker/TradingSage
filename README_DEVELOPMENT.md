# MT5 Trading Bot - Development Guide

## üö® REAL MONEY TRADING BOT - USE WITH CAUTION

This trading bot is designed for **REAL MONEY trading** with MetaTrader 5. All trades executed will use actual funds from your trading account.

## Development Environment Setup

### 1. Mock Library for Testing

Since MetaTrader5 library only works on Windows with MT5 terminal installed, this project includes a mock library (`mt5_mock.py`) for development and testing on other platforms.

**Features of Mock Library:**
- Simulates all MT5 API functions
- Generates realistic price data
- Provides mock account info (1M IDR balance)
- Supports all major currency pairs and instruments
- Returns realistic tick data and historical rates

### 2. Real vs Mock Mode

The application automatically detects the environment:

```python
# Real MT5 (Windows with MT5 terminal)
‚úÖ Real MetaTrader5 library loaded

# Development mode (other platforms)
üé≠ Mock MetaTrader5 library loaded (development mode)
```

### 3. Testing the Bot

In development mode, you can:

1. **Connect to MT5**: Uses mock connection
2. **Test all symbols**: EURUSD, XAUUSD, BTCUSD, etc.
3. **Execute mock trades**: Simulates real trading flow
4. **Test all TP/SL units**: pips, price, percent, money
5. **Test all strategies**: Scalping, Intraday, Arbitrage, HFT

### 4. Key Testing Scenarios

#### A. Percent TP/SL Testing
The critical issue reported was percent TP/SL calculations. Test with:
- Balance: 1,000,000 IDR (mock)
- TP: 1% (should target 10,000 IDR profit)  
- SL: 0.5% (should risk 5,000 IDR loss)

#### B. Symbol Compatibility
Test with various symbols:
- Forex: EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY
- Precious Metals: XAUUSD, XAUUSDm
- Crypto: BTCUSD, BTCUSDm

#### C. Strategy Testing
Each strategy has different parameters:
- **Scalping**: TP=5, SL=3, Interval=5s
- **Intraday**: TP=20, SL=10, Interval=10s  
- **Arbitrage**: TP=15, SL=8, Interval=3s
- **HFT**: TP=3, SL=2, Interval=1s
